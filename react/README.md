# Introduction

This sample demonstrates how to initiate login actions that specify the operations required to authorize with a username and password. 
It uses PingOne flow orchestration service to authorize the application or user that initiated the authentication request. 
This service is responsible for initiating the authentication session and making calls to specific actions required by the authentication workflow.

Flow endpoint operations are used only to implement custom authentication UIs. 
OIDC/OAuth 2 requests initiate the flow and redirect the browser to the custom authentication UI (which is configured in the application through the application’s `loginPageUrl` property.)

To summarize, this sample code contains an example of:
- new user registration
- user login
- user login with external social login providers
- forget password flow
- update password


## Application Type
PingOne supports several application types, but for this sample better to choose **Single page** (runs on the client side after it loads, so it can't keep a client secret) or **[Native](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8252)** ( typically intended for mobile devices) application type with : auth code,  implicit or refresh token grant types.

The application type determines the authorization flow steps needed to acquire an access token from the authorization service. 

The following examples describe `authorization_code` and `implicit` [authorization flows](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/main/v1/api/#configure-an-application-with-an-authorization-code-grant) for the designated application type.


__Authorization code grant type__

This flow uses the `GET /{environmentId}/flows/{flowId}` endpoint to retrieve the login action steps, and the POST `/{environmentId}/flows/{flowId}/password` endpoint
 to validate the username and password required by the login action. After all login action steps in the flow are completed, the `GET /{environmentId}/as/resume` endpoint continues processing the authorization request.

`curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://auth.pingone.com/{environmentID}/as/resume?flowId={flowID}'`
After restarting the authorization flow, you can submit the authorization code through a request to the `POST /{environmentId}/as/token` endpoint to exchange it for an access `token` and an `id_token`.

`curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://auth.pingone.com/{envID}/as/token' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data 'grant_type=authorization_code&code={authCode}&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com'`
The **`grant_type`** and **`code`** parameter values **are required in the request body**. The `redirect_uri` is a required parameter only if it was included in the original `GET /{environmentId}/as/authorize` request.


__Implicit grant type__

Application is issued an access token without requiring an authorization code exchange. When the request is made to the `/{environmentId}/as/authorize` endpoint for an implicit grant, the value of the `response_type` parameter is set to `token` or `id_token`.
After all login action steps in the flow are completed successfully, the `GET /{environmentId}/as/resume` endpoint continues processing the authorization request.

`curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://auth.pingone.com/{environmentID}/as/resume?flowId={flowID}'`
The authorization service generates the access token for the application after restarting the authorization flow; it does not require a step to call the `/{environmentId}/as/token` endpoint.
The `response_type=` **`token`** or **`id_token`** **is required**.

## Application, grant and response type relationships
The following table shows the relationships between the application type attribute and the default `grantTypes`, `response_type`, and `tokenEndpointAuthMethod` attributes.

|    Application type   |    Grant type   |    Response type   |    Token endpoint authentication method   |
| --------------------- |   ------------- |------------------- |------------------------------------------ |
| Non-interactive	| client_credentials	| token	| client_secret_basic| 
| Native	| authorization_code, implicit	| token, id_token, code	| none| 
| Web	| authorization_code	| code	| client_secret_basic| 
| Single-page	| implicit	| token, id_token	| none| 

## External Identity Providers 

An identity provider configuration allows linked users to authenticate and gain access to PingOne resources using the login flow and credentials provided by the external identity provider.
For now PingOne supports Facebook and SAML as external identity providers.

### Social Login Configuration

The PingOne identity provider resource representing an external provider includes mapping attributes that reference the user attribute (or attributes) from the external identity provider that are mapped to PingOne user attributes.
To add Facebook as the the external identity provider, please follow this steps:
- create a new connection under ***Identity Providers**  in the PingOne admin console (check [Identity providers](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/platform/v1/api/#identity-providers) for more information)
- in PingOne admin console, select your Sign-on policy, click edit and under **Enabled Identity Providers** select the previously added connection
- make sure that external identity provider will accept PingOne domain redirect url. For the Facebook Login, please set under **Client OAuth Settings** URL with a following pattern: `https://auth.pingone.com/<YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_ID>/rp/callback/facebook` under **Valid OAuth Redirect URIs** 

# Getting Started

1. Clone a source code
`git clone git@github.com:pingidentity/pingone-sample-custom-signon.git . `
2. To change PingOne API public endpoints, application logo or [custom environment variables](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables)(i.e `REACT_APP_STAGE`), please navigate to [config.js](./src/config.js) file.
3. Build a project by `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Start an application by `npm start` or `yarn start`
5. 
6. Modify the url by adding envId and flowId 


## PingOne APIs used in this sample
### Flow API:
|    Endpoint   |    Description   |
| ------------- |------------- |
| [`GET /{environmentId}/flows/{flowID}`](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/platform/v1/api/#get-read-flow) <br> `Content-Type: application/json` | Retrieve information about a flow |
| [`POST /{environmentId}/flows/{flowID}`](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/platform/v1/api/#post-reset-flow) <br> `Content-Type: application/vnd.pingidentity.session.reset+json`  | Update (or reset) a flow orchestration session |
| [`POST /{environmentId}/flows/{flowID}`](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/platform/v1/api/#post-register-user) <br> `Content-Type: application/vnd.pingidentity.user.register+json`  | Register a user |
| [`POST /{environmentId}/flows/{flowID}`](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/platform/v1/api/#post-check-usernamepassword) <br> `Content-Type: application/vnd.pingidentity.usernamePassword.check+json`  | Login with username and password|
| [`POST /{environmentId}/flows/{flowID}`](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/platform/v1/api/#post-reset-password) <br> `Content-Type: application/vnd.pingidentity.password.reset+json`  | Change (or reset) the user’s password |
| [`POST /{environmentId}/flows/{flowID}`](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/platform/v1/api/#post-recover-password) <br> `Content-Type: application/vnd.pingidentity.password.recover+json`  | Recover the account and set a new password |
| [`POST /{environmentId}/flows/{flowID}`](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/platform/v1/api/#post-send-resend-recovery-code) <br> `Content-Type: application/vnd.pingidentity.password.sendRecoveryCode`  | Send the OTP to the user |
| [`POST /{environmentId}/flows/{flowID}`](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/platform/v1/api/#post-verify-user) <br> `Content-Type: application/vnd.pingidentity.user.verify+json`  | Verify the user account to continue the authentication flow |
| [`POST /{environmentId}/flows/{flowID}`](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/platform/v1/api/#post-send-resend-verification-code) <br> `Content-Type: application/vnd.pingidentity.user.sendVerificationCode+json`  | Send the user a new account verification email |


**Note:** For any application type (except non-interactive), you can specify either `none`, `client_secret_basic`, or `client_secret_post` as the `tokenEndpointAuthMethod` attribute value. Non-interactive applications use the `client_credentials` grant type, which does not support a `tokenEndpointAuthMethod` value of none.

# Developer Notes

This sample includes scripts and configuration used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). So you don’t need to install or configure tools like Webpack or Babel.
They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

1. In case you want to experience more OIDC and other [PingOne Management APIs](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/platform/v1/api/#management-apis) without enforcing CORS, you can open another instance of chrome with disabled security (without closing other running chrome instances):
on Mac terminal:
```bash
open -n -a "Google Chrome" --args --user-data-dir=/tmp/temp_chrome_user_data_dir http://localhost:3000/ --disable-web-security
```
Otherwise you will see such error like *"No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource"* on some actions.


2. `combineReducers` resulting reducer calls every child reducer, and gathers their results into a single _state_ object. __The state produced by combineReducers() namespaces the states of each reducer under their keys as passed to combineReducers()__
Example:
```typescript jsx
rootReducer = combineReducers({flow: flowReducer, user: userReducer})
// This would produce the following state object
{
  flow: {
    // ... flow, and other state managed by the flowReducer ...
  },
  user: {
    // ... user, and other state managed by the userReducer ...
  }
}
```

3. `componentDidMount` is only called once in the lifecycle of any component, re-render will not reinitialize the component. `componentDidUpdate` will be called where you can manage your logic.
4. Redux state doesn't remain after a page reload. `window.location = '/addMembers'` cause a page reload and it's not the correct way to programmatically navigate to another page when you use react-router. Instead of that you should use `this.props.history.push('/addMembers')`.

# Best Practises
1. Keep UI state and transitory data (such as form inputs) in local state (i.e [controlled component](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) to fill out a form).
2. Keep data that you intend to share across components in Redux store.
3. We used [`redux-freeze`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-freeze) middleware that is useful during development mode to ensure that no part of the app accidentally mutates the state (error will be thrown by the runtime).


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. If you see CORS related issues like **"Origin is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin"**, please open another instance of your browser with disabled security.
If you are using Chrome on Mac OS, then start it as:
```bash
open -n -a "Google Chrome" --args --user-data-dir=/tmp/temp_chrome_user_data_dir http://localhost:3000/ --disable-web-security
```

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`  or `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`  or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
